ANALYSIS

RESTATE the problem clearly and without ambiguity

OUTPUT to monitor:
  out_variable_name1 (variable_type) - description (only when needed)
  out_variable_name2 (variable_type) - description
  . . .

INPUT from keyboard:
  (Note:  you can list converted variables here,
          rather than clutter the section with
          string versions that must be converted)
  in_variableName1 (variable_type) - description (only when needed)
  . . .

GIVENS (i.e., program constants):
  NAMED_CONSTANT1 (variable_type) - value
  NAMED_CONSTANT2 (variable_type) - value
  . . .
