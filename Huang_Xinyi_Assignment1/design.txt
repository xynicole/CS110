ANALYSIS

RESTATEMENT:
  Ask a user how many people in a room and output the total number of handshakes in times

OUTPUT to monitor:
  total_times (int) - total number of handshakes in times

INPUT from keyboard:
  people_count (int)

FORMULAS:
  n * (n - 1) / 2 

GIVENS: 
  PEOPLE_NUMBER (int) >= 0
  N_VALUE(int) - number of people in a room
